src/containers are the glue between the view and the model layer.
If no state container is used src/store may not exist or may exist
but in a different form. Either way container components are used
to provide state to the view components themselves. With redux 
a container component gets state from the store and maps it to 
the view components props. Without Redux we may still have container
components but they would be more simple components that provide 
state via react local state and pass it down to other components.
A container component can be used at any layer in the DOM tree.
