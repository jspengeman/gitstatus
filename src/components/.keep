src/components is a library of React components. I think of this directory
as if I was building a third party component library. The components need
to be sufficently generic to live in this directory and the interfaces 
must be flexible enough to support multiple use cases. Put simply, 
src/components is the view layer of the application.

A typically component might look like:
src/components/MyComponent/index.js
src/components/MyComponent/MyComponent.jsx
src/components/MyComponent/AnotherResource.svg
src/components/MyComponent/styles.css

or more simply

src/components/MyComponent.jsx
